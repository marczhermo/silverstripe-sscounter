# SilverStripe SSCounter Field Module

## Overview

SSCounter is simple sprinkle of React and Redux to a normal implementation of `TextField`.
This is an exercise about learning and creating a SilverStripe 4.x module with React and Redux on top of it.
Improvements will be based on the Author's progress with the said technologies.
Feel free to learn from it but don't use it as a single source of truth. :)

## Installation

```
$ composer require silverstripe/marcz-sscounter
```

You'll also need to run `vendor/bin/sake dev/build`.

## Documentation

So this is an implementaion of `TextField`, and to illustrate the idea.
We will create a simple Data Object called `SampleCounter`

File: `mysite/code/Model/SampleCounter.php`

```
<?php
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use SilverStripe\Forms\TextField;

class SampleCounter extends DataObject
{
    private static $db = [
        'Name'           => 'Varchar',
        'InfoCounter'    => 'Int',
        'SuccessCounter' => 'Int',
        'WarningCounter' => 'Int',
        'DangerCounter'  => 'Int',
        'HappyCounter'   => 'Int',
        'SadCounter'     => 'Int',
    ];

    public function getCMSFields()
    {
        $fields = parent::getCMSFields();

        $fields->addFieldsToTab('Root.Main', [
            TextField::create('InfoCounter', 'Info Count', 0)->addExtraClass('sscounter-info'),
            TextField::create('SuccessCounter', 'Success Count', 1)->addExtraClass('sscounter-success'),
            TextField::create('WarningCounter', 'Warning Count', 2)->addExtraClass('sscounter-warning'),
            TextField::create('DangerCounter', 'Danger Count', 3)->addExtraClass('sscounter-danger')
        ]);

        $fields->addFieldsToTab('Root.HappySad', [
            TextField::create('HappyCounter', 'Happy Count', 4)->addExtraClass('sscounter-happy'),
            TextField::create('SadCounter', 'Sad Count', 5)->addExtraClass('sscounter-sad')
        ]);

        return $fields;
    }
}
```

And then we will need a `ModelAdmin` in order to create some records.

File: `mysite/code/Comntrollers/AdminCounter.php`

```
<?php
use SilverStripe\Admin\ModelAdmin;

class AdminCounter extends ModelAdmin
{
    private static $managed_models = [
        'SampleCounter',
    ];

    private static $url_segment = 'counters';

    private static $menu_title = 'Counters';
}
```

Pretty much so far this is very straight forward. We now can reload the page with `?flush`
Below is the screenshot of a single record we can create and edit.

Now, all we need to do is change `TextField` into `SSCounterField` to the Data Object file.
Don't forget to update the `use` statement above to reference the namespace.
The edited file should like below:

```
<?php
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use Marcz\SSCounter\SSCounterField;

class SampleCounter extends DataObject
{
    private static $db = [
        'Name'           => 'Varchar',
        'InfoCounter'    => 'Int',
        'SuccessCounter' => 'Int',
        'WarningCounter' => 'Int',
        'DangerCounter'  => 'Int',
        'HappyCounter'   => 'Int',
        'SadCounter'     => 'Int',
    ];

    public function getCMSFields()
    {
        $fields = parent::getCMSFields();

        $fields->addFieldsToTab('Root.Main', [
            SSCounterField::create('InfoCounter', 'Info Count', 0)->addExtraClass('sscounter-info'),
            SSCounterField::create('SuccessCounter', 'Success Count', 1)->addExtraClass('sscounter-success'),
            SSCounterField::create('WarningCounter', 'Warning Count', 2)->addExtraClass('sscounter-warning'),
            SSCounterField::create('DangerCounter', 'Danger Count', 3)->addExtraClass('sscounter-danger')
        ]);

        $fields->addFieldsToTab('Root.HappySad', [
            SSCounterField::create('HappyCounter', 'Happy Count', 4)->addExtraClass('sscounter-happy'),
            SSCounterField::create('SadCounter', 'Sad Count', 5)->addExtraClass('sscounter-sad')
        ]);

        return $fields;
    }
}
```

And hopefully, with any luck we should see the following screenshot when whe refreshed the page. Fingers crossed.
